/**
 * A failed read reported **in place**, inside a page that otherwise rendered.
 *
 * Its whole-viewport sibling is `OutageScreen`, which the root auth gate uses
 * because it has no header to sit under. The split is the point: a page that
 * loaded its header, its nav and three of its four panels must not be replaced
 * by the fourth panel's failure, and a screen with no chrome at all must not
 * render a small dashed card floating in an empty viewport.
 *
 * The surface is still not `/login`. A page that redirects on a network
 * failure sends a signed-in user to a login form that cannot help: logging in
 * issues the same request, which fails the same way, and they bounce again.
 *
 * Every line comes from `kind`. It used to assert an outage unconditionally --
 * heading "Rustrak is not responding", footer "reload once the API is back" --
 * which is right for `network` and `server_error` and wrong for the eleven
 * other kinds that reach it. A `forbidden` was told to wait for a server that
 * was already answering, and an `invalid_response` from a dashboard deployed
 * ahead of its API was told to reload, which can never fix a schema mismatch.

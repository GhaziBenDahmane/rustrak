/**
 * A link, addressed by `href`.
 *
 * TanStack's own `Link` is normally addressed by `to` plus `params`, which is
 * how it type-checks a destination against the route tree. This one takes the
 * built path instead, through the `href` escape hatch the router already
 * provides for exactly that.
 *
 * **That is a deliberate trade, not laziness.** Every navigable component in
 * this app is handed its destination as a string — `item.href` on a sidebar
 * row, `` `/projects/${id}/issues/${issueId}` `` in a table cell — because
 * that is the shape `next/link` took and the shape the design system's
 * `render={<Link .../>}` prop passes through. Rewriting all of them into
 * `to`/`params` pairs is a real improvement and a genuinely separate change;
 * doing it in the same commit as the framework move would have made every
 * visual regression indistinguishable from a routing one.
 *
 * `href` also parses a query string and a hash for free, which `to` does not:
 * `/projects?page=2` is one string here and three properties there.

   * in a pane beside a list the reader has scrolled a long way down, and
   * throwing them back to the top of that list on every selection made the

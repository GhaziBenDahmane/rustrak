/**
 * What a screen renders when a `Result` it needed came back a failure.
 *
 * Three outcomes, and which one you get is decided by `kind` alone:
 *
 * - `unauthenticated` is the *only* kind that sends the visitor to login. The
 *   `_authenticated` guard already gated the route, so reaching this means the
 *   session expired between the guard and the fetch.
 * - `not_found` renders the app's 404. A project-scoped endpoint answering 404
 *   means the project, issue or event in the URL is gone, which is a wrong
 *   address rather than an outage.
 * - everything else renders an outage surface, in place, with no navigation.
 *   An unreachable API must never look like a missing record or a signed-out
 *   session, because neither of those is something the user can act on.
 *
 * `title` says which fetch failed, so a page that loads several things does not
 * leave the reader guessing which one is missing.
 *
 * **The two navigating branches moved into the render, and they had to.**
 * Under Next this was a Server Component calling `redirect()` and
 * `notFound()`, which throw and are caught by the framework before anything
 * paints. A router redirect thrown from a component is not: the tree is
 * already rendering. So the sign-out case navigates from an effect and paints
 * nothing in the meantime, and the missing-record case renders the same 404
 * screen the route-level handler renders rather than routing to it — the
 * reader sees the same thing either way, and the address stays on the record
 * they asked for rather than being rewritten to a 404 URL they cannot share.

/**
 * The whole-viewport version of a failed read, for the places that have no
 * header to sit under: the root auth gate and the layouts below it.
 *
 * Its in-place sibling is `ServiceUnavailable`, which is what a single failed
 * tile or panel renders. The distinction matters: a page that loaded most of
 * itself must not be replaced by one sub-request's failure.
 *
 * Every line comes from `kind`. Only `network` and `server_error` claim the API
 * is down; a `forbidden` reaching this screen is told to ask an administrator,
 * not to wait for a server that is already answering.

 * Every column's width, in pixels, decided here rather than by the browser.

 * ## Why this is not CSS
 *
 * The obvious version of this is `table-layout: fixed`, pixel widths on the
 * fixed columns, `width: auto` on the growing one, and a `min-width` on the
 * table. It very nearly works, and then does not: under fixed layout, when the
 * declared widths add up to less than the table's own width, the browser
 * distributes the surplus **across every column**. So the moment a growing
 * column is pinned by a resize, nothing is left to absorb the slack and every
 * other column silently inflates. Widths stop meaning anything.
 *
 * So the distribution is done here: fixed columns take their `size`, growing
 * columns split whatever is left down to their `minSize`, and every column
 * ends up with an explicit number. The browser is left with no distribution to
 * do, which is the only way to be sure it does none.
 *
 * A table whose columns are all fixed renders at their total and does not
 * stretch. Filling the container is what `meta.grow` is for, and guessing at
 * it -- stretching the last column, say -- would make a right-aligned final
 * column behave differently from every other table.

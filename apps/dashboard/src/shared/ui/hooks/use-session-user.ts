 * The signed-in reader, for any screen under `_authenticated`.

 * The gate resolved this before the route loaded and put it in the router
 * context, so there is nothing to fetch here and nothing to wait for. Screens
 * that used to `await getCurrentUser()` for the second time in one render tree
 * read it from here instead — under Next each of those was a fresh `/auth/me`,
 * deduplicated only by the request cache.
 *
 * It throws rather than returning a nullable user, because the layout above
 * renders the outage screen instead of `<Outlet />` when there is no session:
 * a component reaching this line has already been guaranteed one, and a
 * nullable type would make every call site handle a branch that cannot happen.

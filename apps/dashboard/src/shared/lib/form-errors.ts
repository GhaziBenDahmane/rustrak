 * set genuinely cannot express the reason and the server's own text is rendered
 * verbatim; the client already strips a `message` arriving on any other code.

/**
 * Whether an error on `name` would actually be visible to the user.
 *
 * Two questions, because one is not enough.
 *
 * `control._names.mount` answers "has this name ever been registered". It is
 * **cumulative**: react-hook-form's default `shouldUnregister: false` keeps a
 * name in the set after its input unmounts, so on its own it will happily
 * approve a field that is no longer on screen. That matters here because the
 * Slack dialog puts `webhook_url` and `token` in opposite Radix tabs, which
 * unmount, and marking the hidden one produces exactly the silent dead end
 * this guard exists to prevent: no visible message, no toast, and a Save
 * button that appears to do nothing.
 *
 * So the second question is asked of the DOM: if the field registered a real
 * node, that node has to still be connected. A controlled field (a Radix
 * `Select`, our `PlatformPicker`) registers a plain `{ name }` object with no
 * node, and there is nothing to test, so the mount set is trusted.
 *
 * Both reads are of react-hook-form internals and both are defensive: if a
 * future version changes either shape, this returns `false` and the message
 * routes to {@link SERVER_ERROR_PATH}, which is visible, self-clearing and
 * cannot strand anyone. Losing precision is the right direction to fail in.

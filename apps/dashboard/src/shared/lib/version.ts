/**
 * The outcome of one update check.
 *
 * Four outcomes rather than `UpdateInfo | null`, because that `null` was
 * carrying three unrelated meanings at once: the operator switched the check
 * off, the check ran and you are on the newest release, and the check could not
 * run at all. A caller could not tell them apart, so it could not treat them
 * differently, and the only reason that was survivable is that the single
 * caller rendered nothing for all three.
 *
 * `unknown` is the one that has to exist. Its `reason` says which half of the
 * check failed: `server-version` means the running version could not be read
 * (there is nothing to compare against), `feed` means the published release list
 * could not be read (there is nothing to compare with). Neither is "you are up
 * to date", and neither may be rendered as one.
 *
 * This type lives here rather than beside the action because `version-check.ts`
 * is a `'use server'` module, and client components need to name the type.

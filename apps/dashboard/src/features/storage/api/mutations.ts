 * Everything the storage page's client components call.
 *
 * The two `preview*` functions mutate nothing, so they read oddly in a file
 * named `mutations.ts`. They belong here all the same: the split is by **who
 * calls it**, not by what it does to the database. `storage-cleanup.tsx` and
 * `source-map-gc.tsx` are `'use client'` and invoke them from the browser, so
 * they need the directive -- a `server-only` module would not be reachable.
 *
 * Both are POST on the server too, because a preview takes a `CleanupOptions`
 * body it has to compute against.

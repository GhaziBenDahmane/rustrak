/**
 * The rule this whole phase exists to buy: **the domain does not know the
 * framework.**
 *
 * `features/*​/model`, `features/*​/lib` and `shared/lib` hold the logic that is
 * expensive to rewrite and cheap to keep -- status derivation, stack-trace
 * formatting, session-health thresholds, error copy. None of it should care
 * which framework renders it, and a migration off Next should leave all of it
 * untouched.
 *
 * Measured before this phase: 90 of 189 files already imported nothing from
 * `next/*`, and another 44 touched only `next/link` and `next/navigation`,
 * which any framework replaces with a shim. That 71% was an accident of how the
 * code happened to be written. This rule is what turns it into a property.
 *
 * Deliberately **not** applied to `ui` segments or to `routes/`. Components use
 * `useRouter` and `Link`, and route files are the coupled edge by design.
 *
 * **The rule now bans the router and React too, not only Next.** Swapping one
 * framework for another is exactly the event this was written for, and it is
 * the event that proves it: `model/` and `lib/` came through the migration
 * untouched, because nothing in them had ever heard of the framework. Leaving
 * the ban naming only the framework that just left would retire the rule at
 * the moment it was vindicated.
 *
 * **Why a content predicate and not `dependOnFiles`.** archunit's graph rules
 * describe edges between files *in this project*; `next` is an external
 * package, so there is no node to point at. `adhereTo` is the API for the
 * remaining case, and it is the one the library documents for exactly this.

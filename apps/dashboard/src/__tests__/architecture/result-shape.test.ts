/**
 * AD-9 rule (7): no `success: false` object literal exists outside
 * `@rustrak/client`.
 *
 * This retires the six-different-error-shapes problem: before the `Result`
 * conversion, six actions each invented their own `{ ok, error }` variant and
 * no caller could tell which one it was holding.
 *
 * The rule is absolute, and the one place it collided was fixed by deleting the
 * collision rather than exempting it. `actions/auth.ts` used to mint
 * `{ success: false, error: 'invalid_credentials' }` for login, on the argument
 * that login collapses several client `kind`s into one answer to avoid an
 * account-existence oracle.
 *
 * That argument does not survive reading the server: it already answers the
 * same `Unauthorized` for an unknown email, a wrong password and a disabled
 * account, so the client reports a single `unauthenticated` and there is
 * nothing left for the action to collapse. The union was a translation layer
 * that `loginFailureMessage` then translated back. `login`, `getInvitation` and
 * `acceptInvitation` now return the client's `Result` like the other 74
 * exports, and the form decides that `unauthenticated` deserves one vague
 * sentence — a presentation decision, made where the presentation lives.
 *
 * Reading `result.success` is untouched by this rule. Consuming a `Result` is
 * the point; minting a second thing that looks like one is not.

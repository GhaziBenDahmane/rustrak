/**
 * The running version is told to signed-in people only.
 *
 * A version number is the first thing worth knowing about a host you intend to
 * attack: it turns "is this instance vulnerable to X" from a probe into a
 * lookup. The server stopped answering `/health/version` to anonymous callers,
 * and this rule is the other half of that change -- without it the number goes
 * straight back onto the login screen the next time someone wants a footer.
 *
 * **The boundary is `routes/_authenticated/`, because that is where the gate
 * is.** `_authenticated.tsx` redirects an anonymous session to `/login` in
 * `beforeLoad`, before it renders any child, so a page below it has a user by
 * construction. Everything else in `routes/` -- the login, the invitation --
 * is reachable with no session at all, and so is every component in `shared/`
 * that those pages render.
 *
 * Known limit, stated rather than papered over: `_authenticated.tsx` also has
 * an `unavailable` branch that renders `OutageScreen` without a user. A version
 * printed by a component that only that branch reaches would satisfy this rule
 * and still be visible to a stranger. `OutageScreen` lives in `shared/`, so it
 * is caught today; the rule is an approximation of the gate, not a proof of it.
 *
 * **Why a content predicate and not `dependOnFiles`.** The leak is a *rendered
 * string*, and the import is only its most likely shape. Matching the
 * identifier catches a re-export or a helper that reads `packageJson.version`
 * under another name being pulled in, which an edge between two named files
 * would not.

/**
 * Everything under `routes/` is either a route or a component in a
 * `-components/` folder.
 *
 * **The same rule the Next app had, against a different framework's contract.**
 * There it was "a Next special file or a `_components/` folder", and it existed
 * because sixteen components had accumulated loose beside their `page.tsx`,
 * where nothing could tell whether they belonged to that route or to the
 * feature whose type they rendered. The pressure is identical here and the
 * only thing that changed is the spelling: TanStack ignores a path segment
 * prefixed with `-`, so `-components/` is what `_components/` was.
 *
 * That spelling is not decoration. A file under `routes/` that is *not* in a
 * `-`-prefixed folder is a route: the generator reads the tree and mints one
 * from the filename. So a stray component here does not merely sit in the
 * wrong place, it silently becomes a URL.
 *
 * **Unconditional, with no size threshold.** One component beside a route is as
 * much a violation as eleven. A threshold is a judgement call, judgement calls
 * rot, and the six-component threshold this pattern replaced is what let the
 * sixteen accumulate.

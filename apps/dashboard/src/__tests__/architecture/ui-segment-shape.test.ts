/**
 * Inside a `ui` segment, a file's **kind** decides its folder.
 *
 * `ui` is the segment that grows. Every other one has a natural ceiling -- a
 * slice has a handful of queries, a couple of model types -- but the view layer
 * accumulates components, then the hooks that drive them, then view-only
 * formatting helpers, then a store when client state outgrows `useState`. Left
 * flat, `ui` becomes the `lib/` this phase just dismantled: a folder that
 * groups by nothing.
 *
 * So the same rule that empties `app/` applies one level down. Nothing sits at
 * a `ui` segment root; every file is in a folder naming what it is.
 *
 * **Only the kinds that exist have folders.** Today that is `components`
 * everywhere and `hooks` in `shared/ui`, which holds the single hook in the
 * codebase. `utils` and `stores` are in the list below because the moment a
 * first file of that kind appears, the choice should be obvious rather than a
 * fresh argument -- but no empty folder is created to anticipate them.
 *
 * **Where hooks live, settled.** `use-mobile` sat in `shared/lib` and does not
 * belong there: it calls `useState` and `useEffect` and answers a question
 * about the viewport, which is the view layer by definition. Moving it leaves
 * `lib` meaning one thing -- pure logic, no React, no Next -- which is exactly
 * what [portable-core](./portable-core.test.ts) requires of it. A hook in `lib`
 * would have passed that rule, because React is not Next, while quietly making
 * the segment unportable in practice.

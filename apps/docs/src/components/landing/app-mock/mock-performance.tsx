/**
 * The span waterfall, recreated from
 * apps/dashboard/public/(main)/projects/[id]/performance/[txnId]/span-waterfall.tsx.
 *
 * ── Why this screen and not another table ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every other chapter on this page had settled into the same shape: a header, a
 * toolbar, a bordered box, rows. Four of them in sequence, and by the third the
 * reader has learned the shape and stopped looking. That is a bad outcome for a
 * page whose entire job is to show what the product looks like.
 *
 * A waterfall is the one screen in the product that is not a list. It is a
 * picture of time, it is read left to right instead of top to bottom, and its
 * meaning is carried by the *shape* rather than by the text: a reader who has
 * ever opened a slow endpoint sees that one third-party call costs more than
 * everything else on the page before reading a single label. Nothing else in
 * the app communicates that fast.
 *
 * ── Drawn at 1:1 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * There is no app shell here, no rail and no page header, and the surface is
 * not scaled. It sits in a `Bleed` (see `primitives/bleed.tsx`) at the app's
 * own pixel sizes and runs off the edges of the band. A waterfall shrunk to
 * 0.65 is a set of coloured smudges; at 1:1 the `903ms` next to the Stripe call
 * is readable, and that number is the entire argument of the section.
 *
 * ── The bars are the entrance ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Each bar's `Sweep` is delayed by where its span actually starts in the trace,
 * so scrolling the section replays the request in the order it happened: the
 * order lookup, then the cache miss, then the long wait on Stripe, then the two
 * writes. It is the one entrance on the page that carries information rather
 * than decorating the arrival, which is also why it is not a stagger. A stagger
 * would say "these arrived one after another"; this says *when* each one did.
 */

/**
 * `opColor` from the real component, which prefix-matches so the long tail of
 * op values SDKs emit (`db.sql.query`, `http.client`, `resource.script`) all
 * land somewhere sensible.
 *
 * The app writes these as Tailwind palette classes. They are restated as
 * literal colours here for one reason: this surface sits on the landing's dark
 * band rather than on the app's, and each hue is lifted a step so a 6px bar
 * still reads as blue rather than as dark grey. The assignment is unchanged,
 * because the assignment is what a returning user recognises.

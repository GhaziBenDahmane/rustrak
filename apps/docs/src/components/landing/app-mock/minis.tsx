/**
 * The small visuals that sit in the two-up rows.
 *
 * ── What these are now, and what they were ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * They are fragments of the product, drawn at the product's own size.
 *
 * They used to be diagrams *about* the product, and the tell was the type. Every
 * one of them was set at 9.5 to 11.5px on a hand-mixed `oklch(0.135 0 0)` card
 * with `border-white/10` and labels in `text-white/30` — a palette that appears
 * nowhere in the application and a scale two to three steps below anything it
 * renders. The big screens on the same page are built out of `bg-card`,
 * `ring-foreground/10`, `text-sm` and `text-muted-foreground`, so the two sat
 * side by side making opposite claims: the surface said "this is the product"
 * and the visual under it said "this is an illustration of the product".
 *
 * So each one is now the real component from the real screen, named in its
 * doc comment, using the app's tokens and the app's type scale. Nothing here is
 * invented: if a value is shown, the app shows that value, in that place, at
 * that size.
 *
 * ── Scrubbed, like everything else ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * They run on the same clock the full screens do. `MockStage` publishes one
 * progress value per mini as it crosses the viewport and every mark inside is a
 * function of it, so scrolling back up plays the assembly backwards. See
 * `stage.tsx`. The one exception is a genuine idle loop — the log tail, which
 * has to keep producing lines once it has arrived, because a stream that
 * freezes is a screenshot.
 */

/**
 * The app's `Card`, which is what every one of these actually is.
 *
 * A ring rather than a border, matching `MockCard` and the product: the app's
 * cards are `ring-1 ring-foreground/10` over `bg-card`, which sits fractionally
 * inside the rounded corner and reads softer than a 1px border at the same
 * opacity.
 *
 * `min-w-0` is doing real work here, not decoration. These sit in grid cells,
 * and a grid item's automatic minimum is its content's — so a row of fixed
 * columns inside one would push the cell wider than its track, then the track
 * wider than the page. Floored at 0, the card keeps the width it was given and
 * the rows inside it shrink or truncate, which is what they were written to do.
